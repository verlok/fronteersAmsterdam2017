_These are my notes from Fronteers 2017 Amsterdam conference._

He works for archive.org, "the wayback machine". 
Talks about climate change data, and about visiting his father in a hospital, where he had to stay more than expected, but no prob because he works remotely.
In the archive they also have CD-ROMs, Microzines, flyers, books, etc.
Manuals, they wanted to throw lots of them away, I stabilized my father and drove 5:30 hours to save them loading them in a truck. Now we are the largest collection of paper manuals, and my father is fine.
Then was about to go to Australia, he got sick, he sweated, webt away, and arrived to Melbourn, then had a heart attack. He was talking about videogames, had a beautiful dinner with someone he loved, then was almost dying. I walked to a clinic, they knew a guy who was a doctor, then he was driven in his car to the hospital and the operation room, the old doctor left a note and left. He'd be operated in 20 mins, high survivability. I knew I might have died, so I tweeted this (screenshot). But he survived.
Now what? What do I do with the 2nd half of my life? I'm taking care of my father, I travelled all over the world, worked for a good company.
3.5 million people a day visit the internet archive. They have 33 Petabytes (33.000 Terabytes) of data. We created it because the web eats itself. AIM is going to close in December, they told me because I get told when something dies. :D They also have a copy of the whole Geocities. 
Rage, Paranoia and Cleptomania. We are angry that people destroy things, afraid they disappear, and we take it all.
It's great responsibility. Yes there's a lot of shit out there. We save that too.
He has a cat on Twitter, @sockington, with 1.4 million followers. "The tech industry is fucking stupid" :)
**Add an export function if you can.** 
And please be good. Have a wonderful life.
