## Ghost of CSS Past

I asked some people to show 10 years old CSS they wrote, compared to today's.
Some was HTML, not CSS. Some were all inline. Then all `float: left;`. Transparents PNGs to do rounded corners. Or 4 different GIFs. A lot of magic numbers. And IE5/Mac hacks. 500 lines of code to vertically center an item. A lot of CSS Hacks. A lot of ingenuity on us - we were struggling to make elements appear in the page. 

Everybody wanted rounded corners! Sliding doors technique. Everybody was talking about these techniques at conferences, not accessibility, performance testing, etc. Then `border-radius` came in 2012. And they came 45 minutes talks about border-radius.

Layout. In 2009 I talked about "The future state of layout". We talked about grids, tables, and the specs around that time: CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, CSS Layout. (briefly talks about CSS3 layout and how a layout CSS rule could fit in a tweet). Today flexbox is out and you can use it safely in production. Grid is still quite not supported, but great for websites layout.

Media queries and responsive design. I talked about it in 2011 at Mobilism.

Design systems and components. I saw a talk about it by Andy Clarke. And my talk "Pages to components to systems". 

Yesterday we saw an amazing talk about developer tools. We never discover enough about it. This is something that came out in the last 10 years and they're great. 

Pre-processors, SASS (what a stupid name), cool stuff.

## Ghost of CSS present

It's all React. Just kidding.

The size of CSS is growing. Tripled in the latest 7 years. Total transfer and loading time in our websites are growing and growing. 

Javascript is the thing, too. We're creating more and more Javascript. 

And Fighting against CSS. I like CSS. It's pretty easy to get into. It's declarative, it's inheritable, it's powerful. CSS can be painful, but we're making mistakes in fighting it, we're making HTML look like 10 years ago.

It's a declarative. You don't use Javascript. JS is a programming language, you use that to do programming things. You use a declarative style language to do declarative stylesheets.

## Ghost of the future

The basics are in place.

- Layout
- (Responsive) Images
- Colour
- Typography
- (1 missed)

CSS and developer tools will be more frequently uses as design tools.

From techniques to processes, from processes to people. We don't collaborate enough. We must collaborate to keep it human. 

All of the real problems are people problems.

Shows a tweet "You don't get to define what the web is just because you're old as fuck". I'm probably in that age group. But there's no argument here, it's just an anonymous attack, and it's not directed to anybody who could defend himself. Hint: defend your opponent position and try to learn from it.
