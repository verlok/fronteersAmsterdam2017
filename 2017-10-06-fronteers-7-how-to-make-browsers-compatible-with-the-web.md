_These are my notes from Fronteers 2017 Amsterdam conference._

When something is broken in a browser but not in others, who reported it? Who created a hack?
Poll "Do you report web compat bugs?" - 32% think: too much hassle.

webcompat.com is a website useful to report a bug to browser vendors.

Poll "how well do you know specs for your preferred programming language?" - 45% quite confident.

Many frameworks are coming out, I miss the time when you didn't have to set up a whole environment to make things work / fix a typo. Once we just opened an editor and started coding. But... it was the time of browser wars! It all started in 1991 with Nexus, then 1992, 1993 with Mosaic, 1994 Netscape Navigator which improved Mosaic's usability and displayed pages _as they loaded_! In 1995 IE 1 came out, **1st browser war**! IE 2, for free. JS support in Netscape, and jScript in IE. More HTML tags, CSS support in 1996, in October 1995 IE 4 was relased, and IE become the dominant browser in 2002, IE had no remaining competition. Opera 2000, IE 6 2001, Safari 2003, Firefox 2004, Mobile Safari 2007, Chrome 2008. **2nd browser war** fought on developers and developers tool. 

As browsers started to use the same engine things started to get better-ish. Not for Browser APIs maybe. All browser have one thing in common: **specifications**. So the W3C was created, they get to decide what to implement in the browsers. But since browser vendors wanted to push features out, the W3C started to abandon HTML in favor of XML technology (XHTML?). The community decides. W3C decides what you have to implement, but don't say HOW to implement it. 

You can become a member of the W3C, or the WhatWG, where you can participate to discussions. Why should you? Remember the question from the previous quiz? It's in the specs! Apple wanted to realize this feature, so they wrote the spec. If the community would've contributed back then, maybe this wouldn't have happen. 

Specifications are a set of rules. It's our code of conduct for code. Helping helps to know the specs. We also have mozilla developer network. If you want to know if something works on some browser, you go to caniuse.com. There are also a CLI command and plugins for your favourite editor (_?_)

Browsers are now moving away from prefixes to browser flags. So you don't have to change your code later. 

Driver.io is an open source testing framework for node. Also tests visual regression. 

You have the tools, but you can also become a Wompat. How can you become a Wompat? Think about what you enjoy the most, what you would like to use. Then open the browser of you choice, go to wompat.com and let us know. Join us! And tell to your friends.
