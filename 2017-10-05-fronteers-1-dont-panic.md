_These are my notes from Fronteers 2017 Amsterdam conference._

He starts talking about a guy who held a TV show and created a house of the future in the 80s, and who impacted on his life. He also mentions an astronaut and Tim Berners Lee. "Yes, I'm old". The 90s brought a revolution, the web made new things and worlds possible. 

We, normal people, we change the world! It's a revolution of the people. In the 60s you had to be a rocket scientist to change the world. They travelled to the moon. They were 384,400 kms from home, the same number of identical bootstrap websites. :D

Carousel of titles about the death of the web, the apps killed it, google killed it, no it saved it. No the mobile is dead, no. Buzzwords and buzzwords. But we still have jobs :) Always bet on the web.

10 years ago we couldn't do more than we were used to since the web was born. Then iPhone came out and brought new challenges. The world of pixel perfect layouts were dead, we had different screens and platforms.

Now browsers are everywere. But compared to years ago, now browsers are compatible. Almost. 10 years ago... IE7, IE6, wtf.

Developer tools came, and now we got frameworks. Which made browsers a serious environment to develop apps. Shows a carousel of the names (some were invented :)). React is new, but already 4 years old.

Remember that browsers already have a framework built in, don't forget and don't be afraid to use the web platform.

Features that were added over the last 10 years.

* DOM, shadow dom, etc.
* New elements
* Video included
* Audio playback and generation, speech recognition
* Resp img, 
* web animations, web DB, storage
* Networking, peer to peer
* Devices support, gamepads etc., bluetooth
* Offline support
* JS lots
* CSS gradients, transforms, transaniations, fonts, mq, selectors, etc.

**We're no longer web developers, we need to specialize.**

I struggle to keep up with everything. It's all the web platform. 
Lots of talks in the previous years, intro to webGL, bluetooth.

Who remembers all the old techniques? (mentions a lot, sliding doors, filters for pngs). Let's take a moment to say **goodbye to IE**.

IE was a great browser. 15 years ago. :) 10 years ago it wasn't a good browser anymore. IE7 was outdated the day of its launch. Edge is now keeping up, almost. They started supporting web components!

"It's ok to create a site that doesn't work without JS", they said. 
JS can be extremely dividing. Some say scripting is evil. On the other hand we had people who made everything in JS. Because dealing with HTML, CSS and browsers is just inconvenient. In the middle we have **progressive enhancement**.

Transmit 5 logo, it was made using progressive enhancement. Of course you can't PE everything. You can't PE a video. PE is not a goal, it's a tool. Anyway a bad user experience is just bad. Let's focus on users.

Step back. IE. 15 years ago we had differnet browsers. It wasn't healty. And 10 years ago came the mobile who donated the HTML5 and webkit, which is the base of most browsers today. But they started creating -webkit- prefixed stuff. They maybe thought every other browser should move to webkit. 

So Google forked webkit and created Blink. All mobile browsers moved to Chromium, except Safari. It's ok, because browser diversity is healthy. 

Today again, Chrome is pushing forward and not every feature is available in every browser. We still have progressive enhancement, but it's not fair to not support other browsers.

Google Allo for web (g.co/alloforweb) only works on Chrome. And so Google Earth (why didn't they use webassembly?). It seems that we don't have to worry about retrocompatibility. How many test on older versions of Chrome? (2, 3 people). **Windows XP sticks users to Chrome 51.**

Some websites (Starbucks) now consider Chrome only, not other Android browsers, like Samsung internet, which uses an older version of Chromium. This is too close to "Best viewed with Internet Explorer". We're making the same mistakes. 

Other browsers are now having to implement the -webkit- prefix. It's even in the specs now.

**Don't develop for browsers, develop for the web.**

Some words about Bootstrap. It brings consistency, it's free, it's cheap, it's easy - everybody can do this, even backend developers :). 

We tend to forget who are we building for. We should delight our users. Know who they are and build for them. Then test, test, test.

We don't have to change the world, just leave it a little better than we found it. About accessibility, make it slightly more accessible than it was. Experiment, but don't go over the current edge... build for the future, without forgetting about the present.

Enjoy the conf.
