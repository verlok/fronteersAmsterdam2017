_These are my notes from Fronteers 2017 Amsterdam conference._

WebVR pros: it's easy to access, it's cross platform, it's automatically uploadable.
Cons: not cross-browser at the moment

How to build VR

- Three.js - easy to use, has an impressive amounts of plugins already developed - really complex to do everything
- Aframe - build on top of three.js, you can use only HTML and you can add JS if you prefer

He did a demo of how to build a galaxy in a few steps with A-frame. Very easy and effective (way better on an iPhone 6s than on Huawei P10 though).

Q: The iPhone goes in standby after 1 minute, can we prevent this by the apps?
