_These are my notes from Fronteers 2017 Amsterdam conference._

How do I know if my writing is complicated? It comes down to sentence length and syllables.

## Sentence length
 
Examples of really terrible sentences. W3C's accessibility guidelines: "Readability formulas [..] your documents." 40 words. 

The more complex the material, the shorter the sentences should be. Between 20 and 25 words, the experts say.

You also want variety. E.g. 3 words sentences and 35 words ones. Aim for an average of 20 words.

Example of breaking down the previous sentence in 2 shorter ones: "Readability formulas [..] word preocessor. You can specify [..]"

## Cutting syllables

Comparison to tetris. 1 syllable == 2 squares tetris piece --> 3 syllables == 5 squares tetris piece --> 4 sy = 7 squares. 

Some times long words are inevitables. "Accessibility", "Documentation". So you should mix it with shorter words. PlainLanguage.gov have a super handy list of simpler words alternatives. 

"Prior to" -> "Before"
"I proofread the report prior to the meeting" -> "Before the meeting"

"Commence" -> "Start"
"We will commence user inter interviews on Tuesday" -> "Start user interviews"

"Sufficient" -> "Enough"
"We don't have sufficient staff to run a beta test" -> "Enough staff"

"In order to" -> "to" (4 syllables to 1)
"Use the dropdown in order to select a flight" -> "To select a flight"

"Accordingly", "Consequently" -> "So" (4 syllables to 1)
"We've lost power. Consequently our site is down" -> "So our site..."

"The following" -> "this" (sometimes) (4 syll to 1), or "these"
"Use the guidelines in the following table:" -> "In this table"

"However" -> "But" (3 syll to 1)
"That works in FF, however it doesn't works in IE" -> "But it doesn't"

There's one trick also, use contractions "does not" -> "doesn't", "cannot" -> "can't". 
But can we use contractions? COCA is a DB of 450 million words used from 1990 to 2012 covering sources including newspapers, magazines, etc. It demonstrates that contractions are used much more than the non contracted version. They can make reading more enjoyable.

Next time you're writing something, maybe an e-mail, ask this: do I want to sound like an automaton? :D

To keep your text readable, **aim for a Flesch-Kincaid reading-grade level that is less than 9.** Most people would read in less of their maximum reading level because of real life conditions (distractins, thoughts).

(W3C specs are very badly written)

How does this play out in real life? 
Weather alert written in a college level. 

(Example of a sentence about an hurricane, with reading level of 13.4)

Bonus tip - don't ever worry about a reading-grade level being "too low". Because nobody ever complained about something that is "too easy to read".

Recap:

- aim for average sentence length of 20-ish words
- keep an eye out for any 3 and 4 syllable words
- use contractions early and often

Writing is like a muscle, the more you exercise the better it becomes.
