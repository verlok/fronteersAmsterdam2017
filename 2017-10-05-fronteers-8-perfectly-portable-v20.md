_These are my notes from Fronteers 2017 Amsterdam conference._

Japanese mobile culture influencing the front-end.

Keitai-denwa means portable phone and are the mobile phones used by the japanese people in the past. When she went to Tokyo she was told "you need to have a mobile phone!". She bought one that was smaller than an iPhone 6 but thicker, and she could do lots of things like reading mail, messaging friends, get earthquake alerts, etc. 

Keitai boom.
- 95% mobile subscription rate in Japan (134.8 million subscribers).
- 80% mobile internet users (107.5 million) - it's 2x the USA rate

Back to the 90s, there were the Nokia 9000, 9110, 9200 made in Finland, 1996. It looked like a small computer (google the picture of it)
1999, NTT DoCoMo - cHTML, DML, WDML - i-mode button (i-mode became famouse here too) to connect directly to the network (it showed a connection animation which reminds her of the screechy modem connection sound)

Mobile web history 101 - AY by KDDI, J-Phone, Docomo - Japan is really mobile-first

People, practices and power.

People: average user age is growing, fast adoption, fast saturation.

Practices: 

- mobile web most widespread, at-home internet: rare. Most internet: work, social. 
- Garakei (kei from keitai, gara from Galapagos) are very peculiar phones made for Japan. Some of them allowed you to watch TV on mobile, others had full-capacity camera. 
- Daily mobile access in 2001 was 40 millions compared to 4 millions in the USA. In 2003, nearly 2x.
- RFID mobile payments allowed (FeliCa, Osaifu keitai)
- Mail magazine and microblogging
- Streaming video and TV - before this they had to stare at TV shops to see their favourite team game :)
- Mobile-first approach - Japan came first to mobile-first: mobile access was > than desktop access, bias towards text & blue linking, image mapping, individual identification number (IIN cookie).
- QR codes - originally used for auto industry production tagging, then mobile tagging, hardlinking, and vCard to mobile marketing

Future now

- sumafo, smartphone
- slow market penetration, fast adoption
- 2014: fastest growing segment 5yo or younger
- Case: iPhone vs Android

Takeaways

- Mobile friendly has become the standard
- Improve existing design/usability issues for desktop sites
- End to zombie sites?

Compartmentalization = homogeneity?
