_These are my notes from Fronteers 2017 Amsterdam conference._

I'm obsessed about how your brains work. Brains are fantastic and weird. The zone of proximal development is what is between too easy and too difficult. What you can learn with a right amount of work. It's one level up. This is glorious for your brain, but your brain is bad in self assessment, you can't know how good you are.

Cognitive Bias is when your brains take bad data and build worse conclusions that it becomes attached to.

The impostor syndrome is when you think you have no idea of what you're doing and someone is going to discover you. Here's what it does to you: Feeling inadequate. Avoid displays of target skills, do things alone, quietly. Use of charme, social mitigation. Inreased diligence and dedication. 

Who's impacted by the impostor syndrome? High achieving women. High achieving women of colour. To summarize: visible minorities, especially women. 

I feel good when I'm surrounded by people like me, they care the same, everybody looks like me. But if I look different, sound different, maybe I don't belong here. Internalize discrimination.

What is technology doing about the IS (impostor syndrome)? Social media invites us to compare our real lives with others, feeling more inadequate?

Let's learn how to mitigate it for others.

- Don't ever tell anyone else they have impostor syndrome. "You're not bad at it, you just have IS". Very dangerous. 
- DO: give positive meaningful and actionable feedback. 
- DO: talk about your own fears when you feel comfortable doing so - don't use the word IS.

Fixing it yourself
- independent assessment - certifications, get tested: "oh, I'm 70% not bad"

You can't always stop IS. When you feel inadequate, that's a good time to take a break of it. Don't, like, eat cake in the bath. Some people do excercise. Some others play, some others read a book.

"Do you think stupid people know they are stupid?". They made students make a test and ask how they thought they went. Actual test score is a line. The percieved ability is higher in the bad tests, lower in the best tests. The more skills you have, the more you underestimate yourself. The less skilled thought they were skilled. 

Unskilled aren't aware of their own lack of skill. They are unable to assess and value others' skills. They can recognize their lack of skills and train. They can fix it. But they won't. 

What if IS is a really bad feeling but everything you're doing is fine. 
You're not that special. You don't have a perfect brain that can recognize IS and avodd it.
